1. The bug was that `num1` and `num2` were inputted and read as strings on Line 5 and Line 6 so when doing `result = num1 + num2` in `calculateSum(num1, num2)`, it was doing string concatenation resulting in `result` becoming a string as well. According to `Watch`, with a breakpoint at Line 11, `num1: "1"` and `num2: "2"`. As a result, it became `result = "1" + "2"` so `result = "12"`.

2. I would fix it by performing type conversion on `num1` and `num2` before adding them together in `result = num1 + num2`. To accomplish this, I used the `Number()` method, which is used to convert a variable to be a `number` type. In this case, I added the lines `num1 = Number(num1)` and `num2 = Number(num2)` before `result = num1 + num2` in order to convert `num1` and `num2` from strings to numbers. As a result, `result = num1 + num2` now is adding two numbers, so the type of `result` afterwards is also a `number` type.
